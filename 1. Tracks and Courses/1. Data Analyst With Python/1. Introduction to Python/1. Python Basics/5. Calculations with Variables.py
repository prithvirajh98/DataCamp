Exercise
Calculations with variables
You've now created a savings variable, so let's start saving!

Instead of calculating with the actual values, you can use variables instead. The savings variable you created in the previous exercise with a value of 100 is available to you.

How much money would you have saved four months from now, if you saved $10 each month?

Instructions
100 XP
Create a variable monthly_savings, equal to 10 and num_months, equal to 4.
Multiply monthly_savings by num_months and save it to new_savings.
Add new_savings to savings, saving the sum as total_savings.
Print the value of total_savings.

savings = 100

# Create the variables monthly_savings and num_months
monthly_savings = 10
num_months = 4

# Multiply monthly_savings and num_months
new_savings = monthly_savings * num_months

# Add new_savings to your savings
total_savings = new_savings + savings

# Print total_savings
print(total_savings)
