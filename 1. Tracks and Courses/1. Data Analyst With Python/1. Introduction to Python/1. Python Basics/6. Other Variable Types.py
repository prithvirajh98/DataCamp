Exercise
Other variable types
In the previous exercise, you worked with the integer Python data type:

int, or integer: a number without a fractional part. savings, with the value 100, is an example of an integer.
Next to numerical data types, there are three other very common data types:

float, or floating point: a number that has both an integer and fractional part, separated by a point. 1.1, is an example of a float.
str, or string: a type to represent text. You can use single or double quotes to build a string.
bool, or boolean: a type to represent logical values. It can only be True or False (the capitalization is important!).
