Exercise
The Python Interface
Hit Run Code to run your first Python code with Datacamp and see the output!

Notice the script.py window; this is where you can type Python code to solve exercises. You can hit Run Code and Submit Answer as often as you want. If you're stuck, you can click Get Hint, and ultimately Get Solution.

You can also use the IPython Shell interactively by typing commands and hitting Enter. Here, your code will not be checked for correctness so it is a great way to experiment.

Instructions
100 XP
Experiment in the IPython Shell; type 5 / 8, for example.
Add another line of code to script.py, print(7 + 10), to be checked for correctness.
Hit Submit Answer to execute the Python script and receive feedback.
