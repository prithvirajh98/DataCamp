As a data scientist, some notions of geometry never hurt. Let's refresh some of the basics.

For a fancy clustering algorithm, you want to find the circumference,
, and area,
, of a circle. When the radius of the circle is r, you can calculate
 and
 as:


In Python, the symbol for exponentiation is **. This operator raises the number to its left to the power of the number to its right. For example 3**4 is 3 to the power of 4 and will give 81.

To use the constant pi, you'll need the math package. A variable r is already coded in the script. Fill in the code to calculate C and A and see how the print() functions create some nice printouts.

Import the math package. Now you can access the constant pi with math.pi.
Calculate the circumference of the circle and store it in C.
Calculate the area of the circle and store it in A.

# Import the math package
import math

# Definition of radius
r = 0.43

# Calculate C
C = 2 * math.pi * r

# Calculate A
A = math.pi * r ** 2

# Build printout
print("Circumference: " + str(C))
print("Area: " + str(A))
