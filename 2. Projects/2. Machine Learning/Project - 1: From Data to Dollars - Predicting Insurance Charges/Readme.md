Project - 1: From Data to Dollars - Predicting Insurance Charges

Develop a regression model using the insurance.csv dataset to predict charges. Evaluate the model's accuracy using the R-Squared Score. Then, apply the model to estimate predicted_charges for unseen data in validation_dataset.csv.

Build a regression model to predict charges using the insurance.csv dataset. Evaluate the R-Squared Score of your trained model and save it as a variable named r2_score. The model's success will be assessed based on its R-Squared Score, which must exceed a threshold of 0.65.

Use the trained model to predict charges for the data in validation_dataset.csv. Store the predictions in a new column named predicted_charges within the validation dataset, and save it as a pandas DataFrame called validation_data. Ensure a minimum basic charge of 1000.

⚠️ Note: If you encounter errors during model training, make sure the insurance DataFrame is properly cleaned and ready for modeling.
